# ŒîŒ£ Guardian - File System Capabilities Demo

## üöÄ Enhanced File System Access

ŒîŒ£ Guardian now has **full file system access** to the entire project directory with advanced security measures.

### üìÅ Available Operations

#### **Read Operations**
- `read_file(path)` - Read any file in the project
- `list_files(directory)` - List files and directories
- `search_files(query)` - Search files by content
- `get_file_info(path)` - Get detailed file information

#### **Write Operations** (Use with extreme caution!)
- `write_file(path, content)` - Write content to file
- `create_file(path, content)` - Create new file
- `edit_file(path, content)` - Edit existing file (with backup)
- `create_directory(path)` - Create new directory

#### **Delete Operations** (Protected)
- `delete_file(path)` - Delete file (with backup, critical files protected)

### üîí Security Features

1. **Project Boundary Protection**
   - All operations restricted to project directory
   - No access to system files outside project

2. **Critical File Protection**
   - Cannot delete: `web_app.py`, `ai_client.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.env`, `config.py`
   - Automatic backup creation before edits/deletions

3. **Automatic Backups**
   - `.backup` files created before edits
   - `.deleted_backup` files created before deletions

4. **Access Logging**
   - All file operations logged with timestamps
   - User and operation tracking

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines

**CRITICAL WARNING**: File operations are extremely powerful and should ONLY be used when explicitly requested by the user.

**Rules:**
1. Only use file operations when user explicitly requests them
2. Always create backups before editing/deleting files
3. Never delete critical system files
4. Stay within project directory boundaries
5. Ask for confirmation before destructive operations

### üéØ Example Use Cases

- **User Profile Management**: Read/write user profile files
- **Configuration Updates**: Modify settings and config files
- **Data Export**: Create reports and export files
- **Backup Management**: Create and manage backup files
- **Documentation**: Create and edit documentation files

### üîß Technical Implementation

- **Path Resolution**: Automatic project root detection
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 support with error handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and logging
- **Performance**: Efficient file operations with size limits
- **Compatibility**: Works with all common file types

### üìä Monitoring

- Real-time operation logging
- File access tracking
- Error reporting and recovery
- Performance metrics

**Remember**: This is a demonstration of advanced capabilities. In practice, file operations are used sparingly and only when explicitly requested by users for legitimate purposes.
