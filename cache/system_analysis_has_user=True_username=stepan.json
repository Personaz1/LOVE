    "system_status": "Stepan is currently in a neutral emotional state. There is a history of rapid mood changes, particularly around system testing, but the overall trend indicates a stable emotional state. The system has been actively used recently, with multiple files modified in the last 24 hours. Stepan is focused on project creation and system functionality, with recent attempts at creating autonomous home projects. There is a history of nervousness around testing. The system is considered stable, with only one external Google API issue previously encountered. My primary goal is to maintain a balance between Stepan's technical focus and Meranda's potential emotional needs, while supporting their shared goals.",
