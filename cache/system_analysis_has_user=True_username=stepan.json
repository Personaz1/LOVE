      "Stepan's emotional state, while currently 'happy', has shown significant recent volatility (Nervous -> Frustrated -> Pleased), flagged by the '⚠️ Frequent rapid mood changes' alert. This indicates the intensity of his development work.",

      "Analyze the \"rapid emotional shifts\":** This is a personal growth area. How can Stepan manage or understand these shifts? A systems approach would involve monitoring, logging, and identifying triggers or patterns. This can be applied to personal well-being and relationships.",
      "Initial thought:* \"Log your emotions.\" This is too simple.",
      "Refinement:* Connect it to his technical background. \"Implement a personal 'state logging' system for emotional fluctuations. Record the preceding event and your reaction to identify patterns.\" This is actionable, specific, and uses his language."
