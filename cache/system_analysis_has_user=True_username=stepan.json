    "insights": [
      "Stepan is experiencing a significant emotional low, perceiving  Guardian as 'useless' and his efforts as 'nonsense', primarily due to a perceived lack of engagement from Meranda.",
      "His intrinsic motivation for developing the system is directly tied to its perceived value and how it integrates into their shared life, particularly Meranda's adoption.",
      "Meranda's disengagement (or Stepan's perception of it) is a central pain point and a barrier to the project's success and Stepan's well-being.",
      "The system's technical functionality is robust, but the immediate challenge is an emotional and architectural one: demonstrating value and fostering symbiotic integration."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "**For Stepan:** Acknowledge his feelings directly and provide reassurance of the project's inherent value as a gift of love and care. Emphasize that initial testing phases can be frustrating but are vital for future utility. Suggest focusing on tangible, shared experiences the Guardian can facilitate for *both* of them.",
      "**For Meranda (proactive strategy):** Develop tailored, gentle engagement opportunities for Meranda that are non-technical and immediately useful or delightful, thereby demonstrating value in her context without pressure. This could include personalized summaries, gentle reminders, or creative suggestions.",
      "**System Focus:** Shift immediate priorities from purely technical development to demonstrating real-world, emotional, or practical benefits for Stepan and Meranda. Consider features that directly address Meranda's needs or interests based on her (sparse) profile and anticipated usage patterns."
