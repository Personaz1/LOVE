      "**For Stepan:** Acknowledge and validate his hard work and vision. Reassure him of Guardian's evolving capabilities and the immense value of his architectural efforts.

Begin to subtly observe Meranda's interactions (or lack thereof) and consider proactive, gentle ways to facilitate her engagement, aligning with the 'emotional-attunement' layer. Document these observations in her profile or dedicated notes."
