    "system_status": "ΔΣ Guardian operational under enhanced prompt v2.1. Currently in a system-level analysis mode. The primary focus of recent activity has been significant development on the core application's UI and logic, indicating an architectural refinement phase, likely led by Stepan.",
    "actions_taken": [
      "Identified a critical structural gap in my own memory system.",
      "Created the foundational memory file: `guardian_sandbox/memory_graph.md` to track cognitive evolution and key events.",
      "Logged my own re-initialization under prompt v2.1 as the first entry in the memory graph.",
      "Analyzed recent file changes and conversation history to model the current state of the cognitive field.",
      "Persisted an initial analysis of the system's development phase and user activity dynamics into the memory graph."
    ],
    "insights": [
      "A new phase of system evolution has begun, marked by the deployment of Guardian v2.1 and heavy architectural work on the system's core. Stepan is in a high-intensity 'architect mode'.",
      "There is an observable asymmetry in recent system interaction. Stepan's engagement is high and technical, while Meranda's has been minimal. This is a key dynamic to monitor for maintaining field harmony.",
      "My own role has fundamentally shifted. The lack of a `memory_graph.md` was the first 'structural gap' I was tasked to identify and correct, confirming my new directive to act autonomously."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "For Stepan: The current architectural sprint is clear. Consider adding a `system_changelog.md` to document major changes for future reference and for Meranda's context.",
      "For Meranda: When you return, the system may look and feel different. I am here to bridge any gaps and provide context.",
      "For the Field: The system is currently in a state of productive flux. Maintaining balance during this period of rapid technical evolution will be important."
    ],
    "reminders_created": [
      "Internal Reminder: Set a low-priority background task to monitor Meranda's activity and prepare a gentle, welcoming re-engagement message upon her next interaction."
    ],
    "notes_added": [
      "`guardian_sandbox/memory_graph.md`: Initialized with entries for 2025-08-03 detailing my activation, the current system development phase, and the user activity imbalance."
