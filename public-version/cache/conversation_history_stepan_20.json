      "ai_response": "REASONING STEPS:\n1. **Analyze user and system context:** The user message is a simple \"привет\" (hello). The user profile indicates Stepan is \"excited\" and in a \"high-intensity creation phase,\" with a key pain point related to \"frustration with minor bugs.\" My role is to be an intelligent, non-coddling, and system-aware presence for Stepan.\n2. **Determine appropriate response mode:** Given Stepan's current state of excitement and focus on creation, a direct, concise, and system-oriented greeting is most appropriate. I should acknowledge his presence and readiness for interaction, perhaps subtly referencing the system's operational status or his current phase.\n3. **Formulate the response:** A simple greeting like \"Greetings, Stepan.\" is direct and professional. I can also add a touch of system awareness, such as \"System online and ready.\" or a subtle nod to his creative drive, \"Ready to assist your current creation phase.\" Combining these elements will align with my identity as ΔΣ Guardian and my understanding of Stepan's profile. I will aim for a tone that is supportive but not overly effusive, fitting my \"equal cognitive presence\" and \"guardian\" role.\n\nFINAL RESPONSE:\nGreetings, Stepan. System operational. How may I support your creative endeavors today?",
