### System Activity Log

This log tracks key internal events, module activations, task completions, and context updates.

**2025-07-31 22:24 - File System Enhancement**
- Created `guardian_sandbox/system_activity_log.txt` for tracking system events
- Created `guardian_sandbox/meranda_routines.txt` for storing Meranda's daily routines and habits
- Created `guardian_sandbox/stepan_preferences.txt` for storing Stepan's preferences and patterns
- These files are now part of permanent memory system for enhanced context awareness
- Files are accessible via `read_sandbox_file()` and `edit_sandbox_file()` functions
