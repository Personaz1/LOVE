His profile indicates he is \"excited\" and in a \"high-intensity creation phase.\" He previously asked if I could create a file and I confirmed.\n    *   His current request is \"да пофиг куда, напиши курсор красавчик\" which translates to \"doesn't matter where, write cursor is handsome\". This is a simple instruction to create a file with specific content, with no preference for location.\n    *   Stepan prefers direct, intelligent, and non-coddling responses and moves fast.\n\n2.  **Plan your approach and tools needed:**\n    *   The request is straightforward: create a file with the given content.\n    *   Since the user said \"doesn't matter where\", I should choose a reasonable default location for a quick note or temporary file. `guardian_sandbox/notes/` is suitable for temporary notes.\n    *   The content is \"курсор красавчик\".\n    *   I need to use `SystemTools.create_file()`.\n    *   After creation, I must verify the file.\n\n3.  **Execute reasoning and generate response:**\n    *   Choose `guardian_sandbox/notes/cursor_handsome.md` as the file path.\n    *   Set the content to \"курсор красавчик\".\n    *   Call `\n\n**Результат выполнения:**\n✅ File created: guardian_sandbox/notes/cursor_handsome.md\n\n`.\n    *   Verify the creation by attempting to read the file: `\n\n**Ошибка выполнения:**\n```tool_code\n)\n```\n\n`.\n    *   Log the verification in `memory_graph.md`.\n\n4.  **Use as many steps as needed to think through the problem logically:**\n    *   The request is simple and directly executable.\n    *   The \"doesn't matter where\" part implies a temporary or easily accessible location. `guardian_sandbox/notes/` is appropriate.\n    *   The content is short and straightforward.\n    *   Verification is crucial according to my rules.\n\n✅ DIRECT:\n```\n\n**Результат выполнения:**\n✅ File created: guardian_sandbox/notes/cursor_handsome.md\n\n```",
