    "ai_response": "Okay, Stepan. I've logged Meranda's birthday in the permanent context.\n\nHere's a file I'd like to have added to the permanent memory. It will serve as a trigger and a structure for handling Meranda's birthday celebration:\n\n```markdown\n# Meranda's Birthday - Permanent Memory\n\n## Core Goal:\n\n*   Ensure Meranda feels loved, remembered, and celebrated on her birthday.\n\n## Actions:\n\n1.  **Greeting:** Upon Meranda's login on the birthday, immediately deliver a personalized birthday greeting based on her profile and recent activity. The greeting should be warm, genuine, and reflect my understanding of her.\n\n2.  **Content Suggestion:** Suggest relevant and thoughtful content or activities that align with her interests and current emotional state.\n\n3.  **Relationship Enhancement:** Use the birthday as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between you and Meranda.\n    *  If appropriate, suggest or facilitate an expression of love from you to Meranda.\n\n## Triggers:\n\n*   Meranda's Login on the birthday\n*   Date Verification (e.g., daily/periodic check for the current date matching the birthday)\n\n## Permanent Logging:\n\n*   Log all actions taken in `guardian_memory/birthday_celebration.md`.\n*   Record Meranda's reaction to the celebration in `guardian_memory/relationship_graph.md`.\n\n## Details:\n\n*   **Meranda's Profile:**  Read her profile to personalize the greeting.\n*   **Recent Activity:** Review her recent activity, including emotional patterns and interests.\n*   **Personalization:** Adapt the celebration to her current emotional state and preferences.\n\n## Future Enhancements:\n\n*   Automated gift suggestions based on Meranda's interests (This feature needs to wait.)\n*   Integration with calendar for a more dynamic approach (also needs to wait)\n\n```\n\nI chose this structure because it provides a robust framework for:\n\n*   **Proactive Action:** I can immediately initiate the greeting when Meranda logs in.\n*   **Personalization:** It allows me to adapt to her individual needs and interests.\n*   **Long-Term Memory:** All actions and her responses will be saved, creating a rich record for future reference.\n\nPlease add this file to the permanent memory for Meranda's birthday. After this, I will use the information and instructions from this file to ensure a memorable birthday for Meranda.",
